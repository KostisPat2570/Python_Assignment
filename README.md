Please read all the markdown comments above all parts and DO NOT RUN the whole notebook all at once as it contains code that will take unnecessarily long time to run. Some outputs have already been uploaded in the ./data_assignment folder exactly for that reason.

For example, the human genome will not need to be downloaded as it has already been been processed by tRNA-scan and the output is in ./data_assignment.

Thus, please download the ./data_assignment directory which includes all the necessary files to run the Python code. 

Larger files (cds_from_genomic) which were not able to be uploaded to github will be downloaded by the script automatically.
